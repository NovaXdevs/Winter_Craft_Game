# Winter Craft Game  

Winter Craft Game is the core game for **Winter Craft Reborn**, a survival sandbox with a unique frozen world setting.  
It is based on Minetest Game, but reworked and customized to match the Winter Craft vision.  

Unlike Minetest Game, Winter Craft Game is not just a “maintenance-only” base, but will continue to evolve with new survival features, mechanics and community-driven updates.
